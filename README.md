You could add any file type in the href attribute to make it downloadable. All you need to do is point to the file path as well as its type (jpg, png, mp3, mp4, pdf etc). In this example, I used a pdf file; you could use any file type.

Note: the value of the download attribute would be the name of the file when downloaded by a client/user.
